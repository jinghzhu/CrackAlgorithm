## Description
----
Given two strings, find the longest uncommon subsequence. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other string.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The output is the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

<br></br>



## Example
----
* Input: "aba", "cdc"
* Output: 3

The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"), because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba", but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings.

## Solution
----
### Go
```go
func FindLUS1(a, b string) int {
	if a == b {
		return -1
	}
	if len(a) >= len(b) {
		return len(a)
	}

	return len(b)
}
```

### Java
```java
public class LongestUncommonSubsequence1 {
	/**
     * @param a: a string
     * @param b: a string
     * @return: return a integer
     */
    public int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
    	if (a == null && b == null)
    		return 0;
    	if (a == null)
    		return b.length();
    	if (b == null)
    		return a.length();
        if (a.equals(b))
        	return -1;
        
        return a.length()>b.length()? a.length(): b.length();
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
def findLUS1(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
    if a == b:
        return -1
    if len(a) >= len(b):
        return len(a)
        
    return len(b)
```
